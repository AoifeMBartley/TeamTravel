                   <p>To visit the Palais des Papes is to witness the power of the Papacy during the Middle Ages. In 1309, Pope Clement V moved the papal court from Rome to Avignon, where this palace was built between 1335 and 1352. This imposing palace was the most important monument in Christendom during the 14th century and is the largest building of the Gothic period in the world. From a distance, the palace appears to be a giant fairy-tale castle. Visitors can take a tour of the interior to see the 25 rooms that are open to the public. Highlights include the Great Audience Hall, an enormous hall embellished with wall paintings; the Grand Tinel banquet room; the Saint Martial and Saint John chapels, decorated with well-preserved frescoes created by the Italian painter Matteo Giovanetti; and and much more.</p>

                 <blockquote>
                   <p>the Petit Palais dates back to the 13th century and was the residence for Avignon's episcopal bishops before Pope Clement V created the Palais des Papes. The building was designed as a Gothic fort and is distinguished by the crenelated outer wall (defensive ramparts), a typical element of medieval architecture. The Petit Palais is now an art museum with excellent collections, including masterpieces of Italian paintings from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The collection includes notable works by Italian painters, including Sandro Botticelli and Louis Brea. The museum's most famous piece is Botticelli's Virgin and Child painting. The museum also displays Avignon sculptures and a collection of works by the Avignon School of Painters</p>
